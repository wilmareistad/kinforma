This is a project which three different educations collaborated on. We were given an AI-generated brand name, Kinforma, with a new line coming out during the spring of 2026. 

Our goal was to make up our own collection, with a collection name and products, and to make a website for the brand and collection.

Digital design:
- Alva Henriksson (DD25)
- Nils Birgersson (DD25)

Computer graphics design:

- Linnea (CG25)
- Jonathan (CG25)

Web development:

The DD students made a design in Figma. The students from CG created the products in Blender and CAD, and rendered images of them for the website.
The WU students created a website from the design using PHP, HTML, CSS and some JS.
